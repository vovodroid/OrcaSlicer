# Plugin Development

OrcaSlicer can be extended with **Python plugins** that run inside an embedded CPython
interpreter, without recompiling the application. This document is for two audiences:

1. **Plugin authors** — writing a new Python plugin, modifying an existing one, and
   debugging it during development.
2. **OrcaSlicer contributors** — adding a brand‑new *plugin type* in C++ (a new contract
   that Python plugins can implement and that the app invokes at some point in its
   workflow).

Two companion documents go deeper on adjacent topics; read them alongside this one:

- [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) — the CPython audit hook that restricts
  what plugin code may do (today: a filesystem write allow‑list). **Anyone adding a new
  trampoline method must read it** — every C++→Python call must choose an audit mode.
- [`plugin_system.md`](plugin_system.md) — the catalog/loader/cloud‑subscription side of the
  system (discovery, install, update).

## Part 1 — Python Plugin Development

### Where plugins live and how they are discovered

Plugins are loaded from two roots under the OrcaSlicer data directory (`data_dir()`):

| Root | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data_dir()/orca_plugins/` | locally installed / side‑loaded plugins |
| `data_dir()/orca_plugins/_subscribed/<user_id>/` | cloud‑subscribed plugins |

Each plugin lives in **its own subdirectory** containing exactly one entry file — either a
single `.py` file or a single `.whl` (wheel). Subdirectories whose name starts with `.` or
`__` are ignored. Discovery is driven by `PluginCatalog` (scan) and `PluginLoader` (load);
see `PluginCatalog.cpp` and `PluginLoader.cpp` (`find_installed_plugin_entry` in
`PythonFileUtils.cpp` decides which file in a folder is the entry point).

> There are **no bundled example plugins in the repository.** The plugin snippets in this
> document are illustrative — they were written against the real bindings below, but are
> not copied from a shipped, verified plugin. Treat them as starting points and test them.

### Anatomy of a plugin

A plugin is packaged in **one of two forms**, and the entry file in its folder is what
distinguishes them:

- **A single `.py` file** — the simplest form, covered first below. Metadata lives in a
  PEP 723 comment block at the top of the file.
- **A wheel (`.whl`)** — a normal built Python package, for plugins that need multiple
  modules or compiled code. Metadata comes from the wheel's own files instead of a PEP 723
  block. See [Wheel (`.whl`) plugins](#wheel-whl-plugins) below.

**One plugin, many capabilities.** A plugin is a *package* that registers one or more
**capabilities**. Each capability is a single typed unit of functionality — a script you can
run, a G‑code post‑processor, a printer agent — with its own display name. A plugin's *types*
are derived from the capabilities it registers (they are descriptive tags, not a single fixed
role), so one plugin can, for example, offer both a script capability and a post‑processing
capability at once.

**Both forms register the same way**: OrcaSlicer imports your code, instantiates the one
**package class** you marked with `@orca.plugin`, and calls its `register_capabilities()`
method to collect the capabilities it offers. Only the packaging and the metadata source
differ.

A single‑file (`.py`) plugin has three parts:

1. A **PEP 723 inline metadata block** (a special comment header) declaring identity and
   dependencies.
2. One or more **capability classes**, each subclassing a typed base exposed by the embedded
   `orca` module (a script, G‑code/post‑processing, or printer‑agent capability) and
   implementing `get_name()` plus its entry method.
3. A **package class** decorated with `@orca.plugin` (subclassing `orca.base`) whose
   `register_capabilities()` method calls `orca.register_capability(...)` once per capability.

#### 1. The metadata block (PEP 723)

OrcaSlicer reads identity and dependency metadata from a PEP 723 *inline script metadata*
block — a comment block delimited by `# /// script` and `# ///`, with each content line
prefixed by `# `. Identity fields live in a `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` table; dependency
fields live at the TOML root. Parsing is implemented in
`PythonFileUtils.cpp::parse_pep723_toml` / `read_python_plugin_metadata`.

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = []
#
# [tool.orcaslicer.plugin]
# name = "Sample Plugin"
# description = "Appends a short build-environment note to the exported G-code."
# author = "Your Name"
# version = "1.0.0"
# ///
```

| Field | Location | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` | recommended | display name in the Plugins dialog |
| `description` | `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` | recommended | shown in the plugin **Description** tab |
| `author` | `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` | optional | |
| `version` | `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` | recommended | |
| `dependencies` | TOML root | optional | array of pip requirements (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)) |
| `requires-python` | TOML root | optional | **read but not stored or enforced** against the bundled interpreter today |

> **The metadata block no longer declares a `type`.** A plugin's type(s) are derived from the
> capability classes it registers (each capability's `get_type()`), so the same metadata block
> is used whether the plugin offers one capability or several. The PEP 723 parser
> (`parse_pep723_toml`) reads only `name`, `description`, `author`, `version`,
> `requires-python`, and `dependencies`; any other key (including a stray `type = …`) is
> ignored. The same applies to `.whl` plugins — identity comes from the wheel's `METADATA`,
> and the served types come from the registered capabilities.

#### 2. The `orca` module — the plugin API

The interpreter exposes a single embedded module named **`orca`**
(`PYBIND11_EMBEDDED_MODULE(orca, ...)` in `PythonPluginBridge.cpp`). It provides the capability
base classes, the package base, and capability registration, plus the **`orca.host`** submodule
for read-only access to the live slicer model graph, presets, and mesh geometry (see
[The `orca.host` module](#the-orcahost-module--read-only-host-access)). It contains:

| Symbol | Kind | Members / purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `orca.PluginType` | enum | `PostProcessing`, `PrinterConnection`, `Automation`, `Analysis`, `Importer`, `Exporter`, `Visualization`, `Script`, `Unknown` |
| `orca.PluginResult` | enum | `Success`, `Skipped`, `RecoverableError`, `FatalError` |
| `orca.PluginContext` | class | base context, field `orca_version: str` |
| `orca.ExecutionResult` | class | fields `status`, `message`, `data`; factories below |
| `orca.PythonPluginBase` | class | the root **capability** base; subclasses must implement `get_name()` |
| `orca.base` | class | the **package** base; subclass it and override `register_capabilities()` |
| `orca.plugin` | decorator | marks the single package class for the file (exactly one per file) |
| `orca.register_capability(cls)` | function | register one capability class; call it inside `register_capabilities()` |
| `orca.gcode` | submodule | `GCodePluginContext`, `GCodePluginCapabilityBase` |
| `orca.script` | submodule | `ScriptPluginCapabilityBase` |
| `orca.printer_agent` | submodule | `PrinterAgentBase` and its data types |
| `orca.host` | submodule | read-only host access: live `Model` graph, presets/bundle, and zero-copy mesh geometry |

`ExecutionResult` is how a plugin reports the outcome of a run:

```python
orca.ExecutionResult.success(message="", data="")
orca.ExecutionResult.skipped(message="")
orca.ExecutionResult.failure(status, message, data="")   # status is an orca.PluginResult
```

- `status` — an `orca.PluginResult`.
- `message` — human‑readable text; this is what surfaces in error/result dialogs.
- `data` — a free‑form string whose meaning is defined by the plugin/workflow (not
  interpreted by the framework).

#### The `orca.host` module — read-only host access

`orca.host` (bound in `PluginHostApi.cpp`) gives plugins **read-only** access to the running
slicer. It is intended for analysis, reporting, and export plugins; nothing here mutates the
model. **Script plugins run on the main/UI thread**, so within one `execute()` the model cannot
change under you; **G-code/post-processing and printer-agent plugins run on a background thread**
while the GUI keeps running. Either way, treat everything as a momentary snapshot and do not stash
references across runs.

**Entry points** (each raises `RuntimeError` if called before the GUI/model is ready):

```python
import orca
model  = orca.host.model()           # the active Model
plater = orca.host.plater()          # the Plater
bundle = orca.host.preset_bundle()   # presets (prints/printers/filaments/...)
```

**Model graph:** `Model.objects()` → `ModelObject`; each object has `volumes()`/`volume(i)`
(→ `ModelVolume`) and `instances()`/`instance(i)` (→ `ModelInstance`). Bounding boxes are a
`host.BoundingBox` value type (`min`/`max`/`size`/`center` as `(x, y, z)` mm tuples, plus
`radius`/`defined`).

**Mesh geometry — `ModelVolume.mesh()` → `host.TriangleMesh`:**

| Member | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vertex_count()` / `triangle_count()` (`facets_count()`) / `is_empty()` | `int` / `bool` | numpy-free |
| `vertex(i)` / `triangle(i)` | `(x, y, z)` / `(a, b, c)` tuple | numpy-free, bounds-checked |
| `vertices()` | `(N, 3)` float32 ndarray | **read-only, zero-copy**, requires numpy |
| `triangles()` | `(M, 3)` int32 ndarray | vertex indices; **read-only, zero-copy**, requires numpy |
| `face_normals()` | `(M, 3)` float32 ndarray | computed copy, requires numpy |
| `volume()` / `bounding_box()` / `is_manifold()` | `float` / `BoundingBox` / `bool` | numpy-free |

Coordinates are **local** (the volume's own frame, in mm). The `vertices()`/`triangles()`
arrays are zero-copy views into the live mesh and are marked read-only — writing to them raises
`ValueError`. Their lifetime is pinned to an immutable mesh snapshot, so they stay valid even if
the volume's mesh is later replaced.

**Worked example** (declare numpy in the PEP 723 block so the bundled `uv` installs it):

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = ["numpy"]
# ///
import orca, numpy as np

class MeshReport(orca.script.ScriptPluginCapabilityBase):
    def get_name(self): return "Mesh Report"
    def execute(self):
        model = orca.host.model()
        for obj in model.objects():
            for vol in obj.volumes():
                mesh = vol.mesh()
                V = np.asarray(mesh.vertices())          # (N, 3) float32, read-only
                T = np.asarray(mesh.triangles())         # (M, 3) int32
                # World-space coordinates for the first instance (row-vector convention):
                M = obj.instance(0).matrix() @ vol.matrix()      # 4x4 float64
                world = (np.c_[V.astype(np.float64), np.ones(len(V))] @ M.T)[:, :3]
                print(vol.name, V.shape, T.shape, world.min(0), world.max(0))
        return orca.ExecutionResult.success()

@orca.plugin
class MeshReportPlugin(orca.base):
    def register_capabilities(self):
        orca.register_capability(MeshReport)
```

> If the instance is mirrored (`instance.is_left_handed()` is `True`, i.e. `det(M) < 0`), flip
> triangle winding / negate face normals when computing outward-facing normals in world space.

**numpy requirement:** `vertices()`, `triangles()`, `face_normals()`, and the `matrix()`
accessors on `ModelVolume`/`ModelInstance` require numpy and raise a clear `ImportError` if it
is not installed (declare `dependencies = ["numpy"]`). Everything else — counts, `vertex(i)`/
`triangle(i)`, `volume()`, `bounding_box()`, `is_manifold()`, and the `offset`/`rotation`/
`scaling_factor`/`mirror` tuple accessors — works without numpy.

#### The `orca.host.ui` module — dialogs and interactive windows

`orca.host.ui` lets a plugin show host‑owned UI: a native message box, a native progress
dialog, a modal HTML dialog, and non‑modal interactive windows. **A plugin must never import
its own GUI toolkit**
(PyQt/wxPython/tkinter): a `script` plugin shares the host's UI thread, so a second toolkit's
event loop would clash with wxWidgets, and a `gcode`/`printer-agent` plugin runs off the main
thread where toolkit calls would crash. These host calls run on the main thread for you and
block the calling code until they return.

```python
# Native message box -> returns "ok" | "cancel" | "yes" | "no"
choice = orca.host.ui.message("Export finished. Open the folder?",
                              title="My Plugin", buttons="yes_no", icon="question")

# Modal HTML dialog -> returns the orca.submit() payload (dict), or None if dismissed
result = orca.host.ui.show_dialog(html="<h2>Hello</h2> ...", title="Report",
                                  width=820, height=600)

# Non-modal, persistent, interactive window -> returns a UiWindow handle
win = orca.host.ui.create_window(html=PAGE, title="Panel",
                                 on_message=self.on_message, on_close=self.on_close)
win.post({"type": "data", "rows": [...]})   # push a payload to the page
win.is_open()                                # bool
win.close()
```

`message` arguments: `buttons` is `"ok"|"ok_cancel"|"yes_no"|"yes_no_cancel"`; `icon` is
`"info"|"warning"|"error"|"question"`.

**Progress dialogs:**

Use `create_progress_dialog()` for host-owned native progress. It returns a
`ProgressDialog` handle and also works as a context manager, so `close()` is called on exit.
The default style is `PD_APP_MODAL | PD_AUTO_HIDE`; add `PD_CAN_ABORT` if the user should be
able to cancel. `maximum` defaults to `100` (values `<= 0` are treated as `100`).

For script plugins, put the dialog inside `execute(self)` and update it between chunks of
work. Do not create the dialog and then run one long uninterrupted operation such as a single
`time.sleep(...)` or blocking network call; the dialog only gets useful repaint/cancel
checkpoints when you call `update()` or `pulse()`.

```python
style = (orca.host.ui.PD_APP_MODAL |
         orca.host.ui.PD_AUTO_HIDE |
         orca.host.ui.PD_CAN_ABORT |
         orca.host.ui.PD_ELAPSED_TIME |
         orca.host.ui.PD_REMAINING_TIME)

with orca.host.ui.create_progress_dialog("My Plugin",
                                         "Preparing...",
                                         maximum=len(items),
                                         style=style) as progress:
    for index, item in enumerate(items, start=1):
        process(item)

        # update() returns False if the dialog was closed or cancelled.
        if not progress.update(index, f"Processed {index}/{len(items)}"):
            return orca.ExecutionResult.skipped("Cancelled by user")
```

For indeterminate work, pulse the dialog instead of setting a numeric value:

```python
with orca.host.ui.create_progress_dialog("My Plugin",
                                         "Waiting for printer...",
                                         style=orca.host.ui.PD_APP_MODAL |
                                               orca.host.ui.PD_CAN_ABORT) as progress:
    while not finished():
        if not progress.pulse("Waiting for printer..."):
            return orca.ExecutionResult.skipped("Cancelled by user")
        wait_for_next_poll()
```

Handle methods:

| Python call | Effect |
|---|---|
| `progress.update(value, message="")` | set the determinate progress value; returns `False` if closed/cancelled |
| `progress.pulse(message="")` | advance an indeterminate progress step; returns `False` if closed/cancelled |
| `progress.start_pulse(interval_ms=100, message="")` | start timer-driven pulsing on the UI thread |
| `progress.stop_pulse()` | stop timer-driven pulsing |
| `progress.close()` | close the dialog |
| `progress.is_open()` | return whether the host still has the dialog registered |

Because `start_pulse()` has no return value, use explicit `update()` or `pulse()` calls at
natural cancellation points if the dialog includes `PD_CAN_ABORT`.

The style constants exposed by `orca.host.ui` mirror `wxProgressDialog`: `PD_APP_MODAL`,
`PD_AUTO_HIDE`, `PD_CAN_ABORT`, `PD_CAN_SKIP`, `PD_ELAPSED_TIME`, `PD_ESTIMATED_TIME`, and
`PD_REMAINING_TIME`. `PD_CAN_SKIP` is available for style parity, but the current Python
handle does not expose a separate "skip" state.

**The page talks back through `window.orca`** (injected automatically; the page supplies raw,
self‑contained HTML/CSS/JS):

| JS call | Effect |
|---|---|
| `orca.postMessage(obj)` | deliver `obj` to the plugin's `on_message(obj)` |
| `orca.onMessage(cb)` | `cb(data)` runs for each `win.post(data)` (and modal pushes) |
| `orca.submit(obj)` | (modal) close and return `obj` from `show_dialog` |
| `orca.close()` | close the dialog / window |

**Theming (automatic light/dark):**

The host injects a stylesheet that matches OrcaSlicer's **current theme** (the active
light/dark mode, fonts, background/foreground, accent and border colors) *before* your page
renders. An unstyled page already looks native — `<body>`, headings, `button`,
`input`/`select`/`textarea`, `table`, links and scrollbars get sensible themed defaults — and
the theme is also exposed as CSS variables so you can match the rest of the UI:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--orca-bg` | window/background color |
| `--orca-fg` | primary text color |
| `--orca-muted` | secondary / label text color |
| `--orca-accent` | accent color (buttons, links, focus) |
| `--orca-accent-fg` | text color on the accent |
| `--orca-border` | subtle border / separator / row‑hover color |
| `--orca-font` | UI font stack |

The injected rules use only low specificity and never `!important`, so **any CSS your page
ships overrides them**. Prefer the variables (e.g. `border:1px solid var(--orca-border)`) over
hardcoded colors so your dialog follows light *and* dark mode automatically. The UI sample
([`host_ui_panel.py`](examples/host_ui_panel.py)) relies on this and uses no fixed colors.

**Threading & lifecycle:**

- Host UI calls run on the main thread and **block the calling code** until they return
  (`message`/`show_dialog` when the dialog closes; `create_window`/`create_progress_dialog`
  as soon as the window/dialog is shown; progress updates after the host applies them). From
  a `script` plugin — already on the UI thread — they run inline; from a background-thread
  plugin (`gcode`/`printer-agent`) they marshal to the main thread first.
- `on_message(data)` runs on the **UI thread** — keep it quick; offload heavy work to a
  `threading.Thread` and push results back with `win.post(...)`.
- A **modal** dialog (`show_dialog`) fits a one‑shot `execute()`. A **persistent** panel
  (`create_window`) is best opened from `on_load()` so it lives for the plugin's lifetime; the
  host closes a plugin's windows automatically when it is unloaded/reloaded or the app exits.
- Content is loaded as raw HTML — prefer **self‑contained** pages (inline CSS/JS). There is no
  CSP and developer tools are disabled.

See [`examples/host_ui_panel.py`](examples/host_ui_panel.py) for a non‑modal interactive panel
that browses the whole `orca.host` read-only API.

#### 3. Registration

Registration has two parts, both resolved at **module import / load time**.

**Capabilities** — each capability is a class that subclasses a typed base (see
[Capability types and entry points](#capability-types-and-entry-points)) and implements
`get_name(self) -> str`. The name is how the capability appears in the UI and how presets
refer to it, so it must be **unique within the plugin** and **must not contain a `;`** — that
character is reserved as a separator in preset references, and a `;` in a capability name
fails the load.

**The package** — exactly one class per file is decorated with `@orca.plugin` and subclasses
`orca.base`. Its `register_capabilities(self)` method calls `orca.register_capability(Cls)`
once for each capability class you want to expose:

```python
@orca.plugin
class SamplePlugin(orca.base):
    def register_capabilities(self):
        orca.register_capability(GCodeBenchmark)
        orca.register_capability(EnvironmentReport)
```

OrcaSlicer instantiates the package class (it must be callable as `SamplePlugin()` with no
arguments), calls `register_capabilities()`, then instantiates each registered capability.

Rules enforced when a plugin loads (most in `PythonPluginBridge.cpp`):

- The `@orca.plugin` class **must** subclass `orca.base`, and there must be **exactly one**
  per file — a second `@orca.plugin` fails the load.
- Each class passed to `orca.register_capability` must subclass a capability base (ultimately
  `orca.PythonPluginBase`); otherwise it raises `value_error`.
- Every capability must resolve `get_name()` (checked in the bridge); the loader
  (`PluginLoader.cpp`) additionally rejects the plugin if the resulting `(type, name)` pair is
  not unique across it.
- A capability class you never pass to `register_capability` is **invisible** to OrcaSlicer,
  even if it is defined in the file.

#### Wheel (`.whl`) plugins

For anything beyond a single file — multiple modules, packaged resources, or compiled
extensions — ship a standard Python **wheel** as the plugin folder's entry file. The plugin
*code* is identical to the `.py` case: somewhere in the importable package's top‑level code
(typically its `__init__.py`) you define your capability classes and the `@orca.plugin`
package class that registers them. What changes is **where metadata comes from** and that the
wheel is validated on install (`read_wheel_plugin_metadata` in `PythonFileUtils.cpp`).

Identity and dependencies are read from the wheel's `*.dist-info/` files instead of a
PEP 723 block:

| Plugin field | Wheel source |
|---|---|
| `name` | `METADATA` → `Name` (**required**) |
| `version` | `METADATA` → `Version` (**required**) |
| `description` | `METADATA` → `Summary` |
| `author` | `METADATA` → `Author` |
| `dependencies` | `METADATA` → `Requires-Dist` |

As with `.py` plugins, the wheel does **not** declare a type — the plugin's served types come
from the capabilities its `@orca.plugin` package class registers at load time.

Additional wheel rules enforced at install time:

- The wheel must contain exactly **one `.dist-info` directory** with `METADATA`, `WHEEL`,
  and `RECORD` present.
- **Platform/ABI compatibility is checked** from the `WHEEL` file's `Tag:` lines. Pure
  Python wheels (`*-none-any`) are accepted everywhere; platform‑specific wheels must match
  the current interpreter's ABI tag and OS (see `PythonInterpreter::python_abi_tag()`).
  Ship a pure‑Python wheel unless you genuinely need a compiled extension.
- The importable entry package is chosen in priority order: core‑metadata `Import-Name`,
  then `top_level.txt` (if it names a single package), then the normalized `Name`.

### Capability types and entry points

Each typed base defines the method(s) OrcaSlicer will call and the type returned by
`get_type()`. Every capability **must** implement `get_name(self) -> str`. Lifecycle hooks
`on_load()` / `on_unload()` are optional and available on every capability (defaults do
nothing).

| Base class | `get_type()` returns | Required methods | Invoked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orca.script.ScriptPluginCapabilityBase` | `Script` | `get_name()`, `execute(self) -> ExecutionResult` | the **Plugins dialog → Run** action |
| `orca.gcode.GCodePluginCapabilityBase` | `PostProcessing` | `get_name()`, `execute(self, ctx) -> ExecutionResult` | **G‑code export / post‑processing** during slicing |
| `orca.printer_agent.PrinterAgentBase` | `PrinterConnection` | `get_name()` + ~30 agent methods (`get_agent_info`, `connect_printer`, …) | the **network / printer‑agent** layer on load |

> **`get_name()` is required; `get_type()` usually isn't.** Every capability must implement
> `get_name()` — it is pure virtual on the root base, and a missing override fails the load.
> The typed C++ bases already implement `get_type()` (e.g. `ScriptPluginCapability::get_type()`
> returns `Script`), so a subclass of a *typed* base does **not** need to override it. Only a
> capability that subclasses the **root** `orca.PythonPluginBase` directly must set its own
> `get_type()`.

> **Threading.** `ScriptPluginCapabilityBase.execute()` runs on the **main/UI thread**: live
> host handles are safe to read for the whole call and `orca.host.ui` dialogs open inline, but a
> slow `execute()` **freezes the UI**. Keep it quick — offload heavy work to your own
> `threading.Thread` (which must not touch the model) and surface results through a
> `create_window` panel. `GCodePluginCapabilityBase` / `PrinterAgentBase` instead run on
> background (slicing / network) threads.

The G‑code context (`orca.gcode.GCodePluginContext`) is passed to `execute` and exposes
read/write fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `orca_version` | OrcaSlicer version string (inherited from `PluginContext`) |
| `gcode_path` | absolute path to the temporary G‑code file being post‑processed |
| `host` | target host, when exporting to a network printer |
| `output_name` | the output file name |

> **Filesystem access is audited.** While `execute()` runs, the audit hook restricts
> writes to an allow‑list. G‑code plugins additionally get the folder containing
> `gcode_path` added as a scoped writable root, so appending to / rewriting the current
> G‑code file is allowed; writing elsewhere outside `data_dir()` is blocked. See
> [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md).

### Complete examples

**Minimal script plugin** — one capability, runs from the Plugins dialog, no context:

```python
# /// script
# [tool.orcaslicer.plugin]
# name = "Hello Script"
# description = "Smallest possible script plugin."
# author = "Your Name"
# version = "1.0.0"
# ///
import orca


class HelloScript(orca.script.ScriptPluginCapabilityBase):
    def get_name(self):
        return "Hello Script"

    def on_load(self):
        # Optional: runs once when the capability is loaded.
        pass

    def execute(self):
        return orca.ExecutionResult.success("Hello from a script plugin")


@orca.plugin

### Dependencies

List third‑party requirements in the PEP 723 root `dependencies` array. On install,
OrcaSlicer resolves them with a bundled `uv` into the plugin's environment
(`PluginLoader.cpp`):

```python
# dependencies = ["requests==2.32.3", "humanize"]
```

Keep dependencies minimal — every dependency is code that runs under the same audit policy
as your plugin and must be fetched at install time.

### Modifying an existing plugin

1. Locate its folder under `data_dir()/orca_plugins/<plugin>/` (or, for subscribed plugins,
   under `.../_subscribed/<user_id>/`).
2. Edit the `.py` entry file. If you change the metadata block, bump `version` so the change
   is visible in the Plugins dialog.
3. Reload (see the iteration workflow below). Note that plugin instances are captured at
   load time — a running OrcaSlicer will not pick up source edits until the plugin is
   reloaded or the app is restarted.

> Editing a `.whl` plugin in place is not supported — rebuild and reinstall the wheel.

### How errors are surfaced

There are **three distinct error surfaces**. Knowing which one you are looking at tells you
what kind of failure occurred.

**1. A message box** — a *runtime* failure of an explicit run. You get one when:

- your `execute()` **raised an exception** — it is caught at the C++→Python trampoline
  boundary, the full traceback is logged, and the exception is rethrown and shown; or
- your `execute()` **returned a failure** (`ExecutionResult.failure(...)`, i.e. status
  `RecoverableError` / `FatalError`).

For **script** plugins the dialog title is *“Script Plugin Failed”* (or *“Script Plugin”*
for a returned failure / success), and the body text is the exception message or your
`ExecutionResult.message`. For **post‑processing** plugins the failure is raised as a
slicing error (`"Post-processing plugin <name> failed/raised…"`) and surfaces through the
normal slicing‑error path. Source: `PluginsDialog.cpp` (`run_script_plugin`,
`complete_with_error`) and `PostProcessor.cpp`.

**2. The plugin details / description area** in the Plugins dialog — a *persistent* error
state stored on the plugin descriptor, not a single run. When a plugin fails to load or has
invalid metadata, the descriptor records an error (`set_error` / `normalized_error` in
`PluginDescriptor.hpp`); for a metadata‑invalid plugin **the error text replaces the
description** shown in the dialog (`PluginsDialog.cpp`). This reflects *state* — “this
plugin is currently broken” — rather than the result of one execution.

**3. The Python log file** — the full traceback. `sys.stderr` is teed to:

```
data_dir()/log/python_<weekday>_<mon>_<day>_<HH>_<MM>_<SS>_<pid>.log
```

(`install_python_stderr_redirect` in `PythonInterpreter.cpp`.) This is the **only** place
errors from background threads your plugin spawns will appear — those never cross back to
C++ and never produce a dialog. C++‑side context (load/discovery messages) goes to the main
session log via Boost.

**How to act on each:**

- **Message box** → read the message line, then open the `python_*.log` for the file/line
  of the traceback. Dialogs show only the message, not the stack.
- **Details‑area / Diagnostics error** → the plugin didn’t load; usually a registration
  problem (a capability that doesn’t subclass a typed base, a missing `get_name()`, a
  duplicate capability name, or no `@orca.plugin` package class) or an import error. Fix it,
  then reload.
- **Anything blocked with a `PermissionError` about a file path** → the audit hook blocked a
  write/read outside the allow‑list. See the *Debugging* section of
  [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) and the `[AUDIT BLOCKED]` log line.

**Prefer returning a result over raising** for failures you anticipate:
`ExecutionResult.failure(orca.PluginResult.RecoverableError, "clear user-facing reason")`
gives the user a clean message. Raise for genuine bugs — you’ll get a full traceback in the
log to debug from.

### Testing and iterating during development

A practical loop:

1. **Edit** the plugin source in its `orca_plugins/<plugin>/` folder.
2. **Reload** — reopen the Plugins dialog / re‑trigger discovery, or restart OrcaSlicer if
   in doubt (instances are captured at load time).
3. **Run** — for a script plugin use the Plugins dialog **Run** action; for a
   post‑processing plugin run a slice/export so the G‑code pipeline invokes it.
4. **Watch the log** — keep `data_dir()/log/python_*.log` open (e.g. `tail -f`). Tracebacks,
   `print()` output, and audit blocks all land there.
5. **Iterate.** Use `ExecutionResult` messages for expected outcomes; rely on the log for
   stack traces.

Tips:

- Confirm the plugin shows the right name and version in the Plugins dialog, and that **each
  capability you registered** appears (with the expected type) in its expandable capability
  list. A capability that is never passed to `orca.register_capability` will not appear.
- Develop against small, fast inputs; for post‑processing plugins keep a tiny test model so
  each export cycle is quick.
- Remember the audit allow‑list: write only under `data_dir()` (or, for G‑code plugins, the
  current G‑code folder). A surprise `PermissionError` is almost always this.

## Part 2 — Adding a New Plugin Type in C++

This part is for OrcaSlicer contributors extending the plugin *framework* with a new
contract — say an “importer” capability type. The system has no per‑type registry/switch for
*instantiation*: a capability's Python class subclasses a typed base, the package's
`register_capabilities()` registers it via `register_capability`, and the rest of the app
reaches the loaded capability instance by `std::dynamic_pointer_cast<ConcreteType>` at the
call site. So adding a type means: define a base + context + result, add a trampoline that
forwards into Python (with an audit mode), register pybind11 bindings, wire one call site,
and add the files to the build.

Use the existing `gcode`, `script`, and `printerAgent` types under
`src/slic3r/plugin/pluginTypes/` as references — `script` is the simplest, `gcode` shows a
context + scoped audit root, `printerAgent` shows a wide multi‑method interface.

### Step 1 — Define the plugin contract (the base class)

Create `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.hpp`. Subclass `PluginCapabilityInterface`, hardcode
`get_type()` to your `PluginCapabilityType`, declare your pure‑virtual entry method(s) and any
context struct, and declare a static `RegisterBindings`. The G‑code base
(`pluginTypes/gcode/GCodePluginCapability.hpp`) is the canonical small example:

```cpp
#ifndef slic3r_GCodePluginCapability_hpp_
#define slic3r_GCodePluginCapability_hpp_

#include "../../PythonPluginInterface.hpp"

namespace Slic3r {

struct GCodePluginContext : public PluginContext {
    std::string gcode_path;
    std::string host;
    std::string output_name;
};

class GCodePluginCapability : public PluginCapabilityInterface
{
public:
    PluginCapabilityType get_type() const override { return PluginCapabilityType::PostProcessing; }

    virtual ExecutionResult execute(const GCodePluginContext& ctx) = 0;

    static void RegisterBindings(pybind11::module_ &module,
                                 pybind11::enum_<PluginCapabilityType> &pluginTypes);
};

} // namespace Slic3r

#endif /* slic3r_GCodePluginCapability_hpp_ */
```

The shared building blocks come from `PythonPluginInterface.hpp`:

- `PluginCapabilityInterface` — `virtual std::string get_name() const = 0` (the capability's
  name, provided by Python), `virtual PluginCapabilityType get_type() const` (defaults to
  `Unknown`; typed bases override it), virtual `on_load()` / `on_unload()`, plus the C++‑only
  audit identity (`set_audit_plugin_key`).
- `struct PluginContext { std::string orca_version; }` — derive your context from this.
- `struct ExecutionResult { PluginResult status; std::string message, data; }` with static
  `success` / `skipped` / `failure`.
- `enum class PluginCapabilityType { … }` and the `plugin_capability_type_to_string` /
  `plugin_capability_type_from_string` / `plugin_capability_type_display_name` maps.

If your type needs a new `PluginCapabilityType` value, **add it to the enum and to all three
maps** in `PythonPluginInterface.hpp`, choosing the string the maps translate. Reuse an
existing value (e.g. `Automation`) if it fits.

### Step 2 — Decide the API surface

Decide exactly what the plugin must receive and return, and expose **only that**:

- **Inputs** go in the context struct (mirror `GCodePluginContext`). Keep it to data the
  plugin legitimately needs.
- **Outputs** should be an `ExecutionResult` (status + message + `data` string) unless your
  type genuinely needs richer return data — in which case define and bind a small result
  struct.
- **Keep it minimal and stable.** The bindings are an API surface plugins depend on;
  removing or renaming a bound field/method breaks existing plugins. Add fields rather than
  repurpose them, and prefer the smallest interface that does the job.
- **Avoid exposing internal slicer/GUI types.** The current API deliberately exposes only
  plain data (strings, enums). Passing raw engine objects to plugins widens both the
  compatibility and the security surface.

### Step 3 — Add the trampoline (and choose an audit mode)

Create `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapabilityTrampoline.hpp`. Subclass
`PyPluginCommonTrampoline<YourBase>` (which already provides the `get_name` and
`on_load`/`on_unload` trampolines) and forward each virtual into Python via
`ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED`. The G‑code trampoline
(`pluginTypes/gcode/GCodePluginCapabilityTrampoline.hpp`) in full:

```cpp
#ifndef slic3r_GCodePluginCapabilityTrampoline_hpp_
#define slic3r_GCodePluginCapabilityTrampoline_hpp_

#include <filesystem>

#include "../../PyPluginTrampoline.hpp"
#include "../../PluginAuditManager.hpp"
#include "GCodePluginCapability.hpp"

namespace Slic3r {
class PyGCodePluginCapabilityTrampoline : public PyPluginCommonTrampoline<GCodePluginCapability>
{
public:
    using PyPluginCommonTrampoline<GCodePluginCapability>::PyPluginCommonTrampoline;

    ExecutionResult execute(const GCodePluginContext& ctx) override
    {
        ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(
            ::Slic3r::PluginAuditManager::AuditMode::Loading,
            [&] {
                // G-code post-processing plugins may also write into the folder holding the
                // current temp G-code file, in addition to the globally-allowed data_dir().
                // The setup callback runs AFTER the context is constructed so the scoped root
                // is not cleared by ScopedPluginAuditContext's constructor.

                if (!ctx.gcode_path.empty())
                    ::Slic3r::PluginAuditManager::instance().add_scoped_allowed_root(
                        std::filesystem::path(ctx.gcode_path).parent_path());
            },
            PYBIND11_OVERRIDE_PURE, ExecutionResult, GCodePluginCapability, execute, ctx);
    }
};
} // namespace Slic3r

#endif
```

The macros (`PyPluginTrampoline.hpp`) do two jobs at this single boundary: log + rethrow the
Python traceback, and open the filesystem audit scope.

```
ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(mode, audit_setup, override_macro, ret, base, name, /*args...*/)
```

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `AuditMode::Loading` (permissive reads, writes restricted to allow‑list) or `AuditMode::Enforcing` (reads also restricted) — see the audit doc |
| `audit_setup` | a lambda run *after* the audit context is opened; use it to `add_scoped_allowed_root(...)`. Pass `[] {}` if none |
| `override_macro` | pybind11’s own `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE` (has a C++ fallback) or `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE_PURE` (pure virtual, no fallback) |
| `ret, base, name, …` | the standard pybind11 override arguments |

> **You must choose an audit mode for every new trampoline method.** Most lifecycle/entry
> calls use `Loading` (so the plugin can still import modules). Read
> [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) before picking `Enforcing`.

### Step 4 — Register the Python bindings

Implement `RegisterBindings` in `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.cpp`: create a submodule,
bind the context/result structs, and bind the base class with its trampoline. The G‑code
implementation (`pluginTypes/gcode/GCodePluginCapability.cpp`) in full:

```cpp
void GCodePluginCapability::RegisterBindings(pybind11::module_& module, pybind11::enum_<PluginCapabilityType>& pluginTypes)
{
    (void) pluginTypes;

    auto gcode = module.def_submodule("gcode", "G-code API");

    py::class_<GCodePluginContext, PluginContext>(gcode, "GCodePluginContext", "Context shared with G-code plugins")
        .def(py::init<>())
        .def_readwrite("gcode_path", &GCodePluginContext::gcode_path)
        .def_readwrite("host", &GCodePluginContext::host)
        .def_readwrite("output_name", &GCodePluginContext::output_name);

    py::class_<GCodePluginCapability, PluginCapabilityInterface, PyGCodePluginCapabilityTrampoline, std::shared_ptr<GCodePluginCapability>>(gcode, "GCodePluginCapabilityBase")
        .def(py::init<>())
        .def("get_type", &GCodePluginCapability::get_type)
        .def("execute", &GCodePluginCapability::execute);
}
```

The base class is bound as `GCodePluginCapabilityBase` (the name plugin authors subclass) and
inherits `get_name` from the root `PythonPluginBase`, so you only bind the type‑specific
methods here. Then **call your `RegisterBindings` from `bind_python_api`** in
`PythonPluginBridge.cpp`, next to the existing ones (look for the
`// Make sure you register your bindings here` comment):

```cpp
// Make sure you register your bindings here
GCodePluginCapability::RegisterBindings(m, pluginTypes);
PrinterAgentPluginCapability::RegisterBindings(m, pluginTypes);
ScriptPluginCapability::RegisterBindings(m, pluginTypes);
PluginHostApi::RegisterBindings(m);
// YourTypeCapability::RegisterBindings(m, pluginTypes);   // <-- add this
```

The shared `PluginCapabilityType` / `PluginResult` / `PluginContext` / `ExecutionResult` /
`PythonPluginBase` bindings, the package base (`orca.base`), and the `@orca.plugin` /
`orca.register_capability` entry points are already defined once in that same function — you
only add your type‑specific submodule.

### Step 5 — Add audit hooks

Auditing is not optional. Each trampoline method you wrote in Step 3 already opts into a mode
through `ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED`. If your type needs a per‑call writable directory (as
G‑code does for the temp folder), grant it as a **scoped** root in the `audit_setup` lambda;
prefer scoped roots over widening the global allow‑list. If your type performs a sensitive
operation the current hook doesn’t yet police, consider extending the hook itself. All of
this is documented in [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) — read it before
finalizing the modes.

### Step 6 — Hook the type into an OrcaSlicer workflow

Nothing runs your plugin until some part of the app invokes it. Pick the invocation pattern
that matches your type and model it on an existing one:

| Type | Where it’s invoked | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `gcode` | `PostProcessor.cpp` (G‑code export / post‑processing) | resolve the preset's capability refs, `dynamic_pointer_cast<GCodePluginCapability>(cap->instance)`, build `GCodePluginContext`, call `execute(ctx)` under the GIL |
| `script` | `PluginsDialog.cpp` (Run action) | `get_plugin_capability_by_name(...)`, `dynamic_pointer_cast<ScriptPluginCapability>(cap->instance)`, call `execute()` |
| `printerAgent` | `NetworkAgentFactory.cpp`, wired in `GUI_App.cpp` | register via `subscribe_on_capability_load_callback` / `subscribe_on_capability_unload_callback`; the callback filters by `capability.type == PluginCapabilityType::PrinterConnection`, then registers/deregisters an agent |

For your new type, add a call site (or an on‑capability‑load callback) that:

1. obtains a loaded capability (via `PluginLoader::get_plugin_capabilities_by_type(...)` or
   `get_plugin_capability_by_name(...)`) and does
   `std::dynamic_pointer_cast<YourTypeCapability>(cap->instance)`;
2. on a successful cast, builds the context and invokes your entry method under the GIL;
3. if your type needs unload cleanup, add a case to the capability‑teardown switch (keyed on
   `PluginCapabilityType`) in `PluginLoader.cpp`.

> **Disabled / missing plugins must not change existing behavior.** Every existing path is
> gated on a successful `dynamic_pointer_cast` (or a `type ==` check) and iterates only over
> installed/selected plugins, so when none of your type is installed the loop or callback
> simply finds nothing and does nothing. Follow the same pattern — never run unconditional
> work on behalf of a plugin type that isn’t present.

### Step 7 — Add the files to the build

List your new `.hpp` / `.cpp` files in `src/slic3r/CMakeLists.txt`, alongside the existing
plugin‑type sources (search for `plugin/pluginTypes/gcode/GCodePluginCapability.cpp` — the block is
around lines 615–623):

```cmake
    plugin/pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.hpp
    plugin/pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.cpp
    plugin/pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapabilityTrampoline.hpp
```

### Recipe at a glance

1. **Enum/maps** (if new type): add a `PluginCapabilityType` value + the three string maps in
   `PythonPluginInterface.hpp`.
2. **Contract**: `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.hpp` — base + context + result + static
   `RegisterBindings`.
3. **Trampoline**: `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapabilityTrampoline.hpp` — forward each virtual via
   `ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED`, choosing an audit mode.
4. **Bindings**: `pluginTypes/<type>/<Type>PluginCapability.cpp` `RegisterBindings`, then call it from
   `bind_python_api` in `PythonPluginBridge.cpp`.
5. **Audit**: confirm the modes / scoped roots per `plugin_audit_hook.md`.
6. **Workflow**: add a call site / on‑load callback that casts and invokes; gate it so an
   absent type is a no‑op.
7. **Build**: add the files to `src/slic3r/CMakeLists.txt`.

---

## Part 3 — Testing and Verification

There is **no dedicated automated test suite for the Python plugin system today.**
Verification is primarily manual, with targeted Catch2 tests where the logic is pure C++.

### Manual testing

- **Loading** — install/side‑load a plugin into `data_dir()/orca_plugins/<name>/`, open the
  Plugins dialog, and confirm it appears with the correct name and version and that each
  registered capability is listed (with the expected type). A plugin that fails to load shows
  its error in the Diagnostics tab (see
  [How errors are surfaced](#how-errors-are-surfaced)).
- **Execution** — script plugins: use the dialog **Run** action. Post‑processing plugins:
  run a slice/export and confirm the plugin ran (e.g. its effect on the G‑code, plus log
  output). Printer‑agent plugins: verify the agent registers on load and deregisters on
  unload.
- **Error handling** — deliberately make the plugin (a) raise an exception and (b) return
  `ExecutionResult.failure(...)`; confirm the message box text, and that the full traceback
  appears in `data_dir()/log/python_*.log`. Confirm an invalid‑metadata plugin surfaces its
  error in the details area rather than crashing.
- **Audit** — confirm a write outside the allow‑list is blocked with a `PermissionError` and
  an `[AUDIT BLOCKED]` log line, and that legitimate writes (under `data_dir()`, or the
  G‑code folder for G‑code plugins) succeed.

### Automated tests where appropriate

Add **targeted Catch2 tests** (under `tests/`) for the pure‑C++ pieces that don’t need a
running interpreter or GUI — for example:

- PEP 723 metadata parsing (`parse_pep723_toml` / `read_python_plugin_metadata` in
  `PythonFileUtils.cpp`): valid blocks, missing fields, malformed arrays.
- Capability reference parsing/serialization (`parse_capability_ref` in `Config.cpp`) — see
  `tests/libslic3r/test_config.cpp` and `tests/slic3rutils/test_plugin_capability_identifier.cpp`
  for local vs. cloud refs and malformed input.
- The audit allow‑list logic (`PluginAuditManager::check_open`, `is_inside_allowed_root`):
  inside/outside roots, `..` traversal, read vs write under each mode.
- Type‑string round‑trips (`plugin_capability_type_from_string` / `plugin_capability_type_to_string`).

Anything that requires the embedded interpreter, file installs, or GUI dialogs is currently
best covered by the manual steps above.

### Cross‑platform and regression checks

- **Cross‑platform** — the plugin code must build and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Be
  careful with path handling (the audit allow‑list canonicalizes paths; keep using
  `std::filesystem` / the existing helpers), and with line endings in the PEP 723 parser
  (it already strips `\r`).
- **No regressions** — changes to the framework must not alter behavior when no plugin of a
  given type is installed (Step 6). When touching the trampoline/audit headers, note that
  `PyPluginTrampoline.hpp` and `PluginAuditManager.hpp` are included by many translation
  units; a header‑only change may need a clean rebuild of the affected targets to take
  effect (see the audit doc’s *Debugging* section).
- **Backward compatibility** — don’t rename or remove bound fields/methods or
  `PluginCapabilityType` values that existing plugins or installed profiles may depend on; add
  rather than repurpose.

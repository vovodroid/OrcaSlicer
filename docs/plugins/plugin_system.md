# Plugin System Overview

OrcaSlicer can be extended at runtime with **Python plugins** that execute inside an
embedded CPython interpreter — no recompilation, no patching the C++ core. This document is
the **architectural overview**: what the pieces are, how they fit together, and the
lifecycle of a plugin from discovery to teardown.

It is the map; the other two plugin docs are the detail:

- [`plugin_development.md`](plugin_development.md) — how to *write* a Python plugin and how to
  *add a new plugin type* in C++ (the authoring/extension guide).
- [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) — the CPython audit hook that constrains
  what plugin code may do (the security deep‑dive).

> **All paths below are under `src/slic3r/plugin/`** unless stated otherwise.

---

## What the system provides

- **Extensibility without rebuilding** — users drop a plugin into a folder (or subscribe to
  one from the cloud) and OrcaSlicer loads it.
- **Capabilities, not single‑purpose plugins** — one plugin is a *package* that registers one
  or more **capabilities**, each a typed unit of functionality (e.g. `post-processing`,
  `script`, `printer-connection`). Each capability type has a fixed C++ entry point and is
  invoked at a specific place in the app; a plugin's "types" are simply the set of capability
  types it registers.
- **Presets remember the plugins they use** — when a preset references a plugin capability,
  the full reference is stored in the preset and can be restored from OrcaCloud on another
  machine (see [Plugin references in presets](#plugin-references-in-presets)).
- **A single, narrow API surface** — plugins see only the embedded `orca` module, not the
  slicer internals.
- **A security boundary** — file access by plugin code is filtered by an audit hook with a
  write allow‑list (groundwork; see the audit doc for current scope).
- **Isolation of failure** — a misbehaving plugin reports an error and is unloaded rather
  than taking down the app; tracebacks are persisted to a log file.

Two broad layers:

- **Orchestration (C++, no Python):** `PluginManager`, `PluginCatalog`, `CloudPluginService`,
  `PluginLoader`, `PluginDescriptor`. These discover, install, and manage plugins as data.
- **Execution (the C++↔Python bridge):** `PythonInterpreter`, `PythonPluginBridge`,
  `PyPluginTrampoline`, `PluginAuditManager`, and the per‑type bases under `pluginTypes/`.
  These turn a discovered plugin into a live object the app can call.

---

## Core components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `PluginManager` | Top‑level **singleton orchestrator**. Owns the catalog, loader, and cloud service; exposes `initialize()`, `discover_plugins()`, install/update/delete, and `shutdown()`. |
| `PluginCatalog` | **Manifest‑only inventory.** Scans the plugin directories, parses each plugin's metadata into a `PluginDescriptor`, and splits results into valid vs. invalid. Loads no Python. |
| `CloudPluginService` | Thin wrapper over the cloud agent: fetch subscribed/owned plugin manifests, download a plugin payload, unsubscribe/delete. |
| `PluginLoader` | **Load/unload lifecycle.** Installs dependencies (bundled `uv`), imports the module, instantiates the package and its capabilities, stamps their audit identity, runs `on_load()`, and keeps the live capability instances keyed by a `PluginCapabilityIdentifier`. Provides `get_plugin_capabilities_by_type()` / `get_plugin_capability_by_name()` and on‑load/unload + on‑capability‑load/unload callbacks. |
| `PluginDescriptor` | The canonical record for one plugin: key, paths, capability/display types, version, changelog, dependencies, cloud overlay, and any error/validity state. |
| `PythonInterpreter` | **Singleton RAII wrapper around embedded CPython.** Init/finalize, GIL handoff, `sys.path`, module loading, and installing the audit hook + stderr‑to‑log redirect. |
| `PythonPluginBridge` | Defines the embedded **`orca` module**, the `@orca.plugin` decorator + `orca.base` package class + `register_capability` entry, and captures/instantiates the package and the capability classes it registers. |
| `PyPluginTrampoline` | The pybind11 override base at the **C++↔Python boundary**: logs Python tracebacks and opens the per‑call audit scope. |
| `pluginTypes/*` | Per‑type C++ capability bases + trampolines (`GCodePluginCapability`, `ScriptPluginCapability`, `PrinterAgentPluginCapability`) that define each type's entry method and dispatch. |
| `PluginAuditManager` | **Singleton CPython audit hook**: filesystem policy (write allow‑list), scoped roots, `Loading`/`Enforcing` modes. See the audit doc. |

---

## Plugin packaging and discovery

A plugin is a folder under one of two roots, containing a single **entry file**:

| Root | Source |
|---|---|
| `data_dir()/orca_plugins/` | locally installed / side‑loaded |
| `data_dir()/orca_plugins/_subscribed/<user_id>/` | cloud‑subscribed (per logged‑in user) |

The entry file is either a single **`.py`** (metadata in a PEP 723 comment block) or a
**`.whl`** wheel (metadata from the wheel's `METADATA`). The **capabilities** the plugin
registers determine which workflows can run it — there is no separate `type` declaration in the
metadata. Metadata and packaging details are in
[`plugin_development.md`](plugin_development.md).

**Discovery vs. loading are separate stages.** `PluginCatalog` *scans* directories and
produces `PluginDescriptor`s — it parses manifests only and never executes plugin code. A
*catalog entry* is just data; a *loaded plugin* is a live Python instance created later by
`PluginLoader`. Cloud manifests are merged into the catalog as an overlay once a user is
logged in.

## The plugin lifecycle

```
1. App startup (GUI_App::OnInit, after network init)
        │
2. PluginManager::initialize()
        │   └─ PythonInterpreter::initialize()  (MAIN THREAD ONLY)
        │        ├─ start embedded CPython, set sys.path / python home
        │        ├─ install the audit hook (global allowed root = data_dir())
        │        ├─ tee sys.stderr → data_dir()/log/python_*.log
        │        └─ release the GIL (PyEval_SaveThread)
        │
3. discover_plugins()  ─► PluginCatalog scans local + cloud roots
        │                   → PluginDescriptor list (valid / invalid)
        │   (cloud login later: fetch_plugins_from_cloud → catalog overlay)
        │
4. PluginLoader::load_plugin()  (worker thread, serialized)
        │   ├─ install dependencies via bundled `uv`; extract bundled .whl deps onto sys.path
        │   ├─ begin capture → import module (runs @orca.plugin, marking the package class)
        │   ├─ finalize capture → instantiate package, call register_capabilities(),
        │   │      then instantiate each registered capability and cache its get_name()
        │   ├─ set_audit_plugin_key(descriptor.plugin_key)   // audit identity
        │   ├─ on_load()  (under the GIL)
        │   └─ store the capabilities; fire on-load + on-capability-load callbacks
        │
5. Use:  a workflow call site resolves a capability (get_plugin_capability_by_name /
        │   get_plugin_capabilities_by_type) + dynamic_pointer_cast<TypeCapability>,
        │   builds the type's context, and calls the entry method (under the GIL).
        │   Each call crosses a trampoline that opens a ScopedPluginAuditContext.
        │
6. Unload / shutdown:  set_shutting_down → unload_plugin / unload_all_plugins
            (the instance's destructor runs on_unload() + Py_DECREF under the GIL)
            → PythonInterpreter::shutdown()
```

A few load‑time invariants worth knowing:

- **`set_audit_plugin_key()` is what arms enforcement.** Without it the instance has an empty
  key and its calls run unaudited. It is stamped at load and re‑stamped on key migration
  (`update_loaded_plugin_key`). See the audit doc.
- A module must mark exactly one package class with `@orca.plugin` (a subclass of
  `orca.base`), and that class's `register_capabilities()` must register at least one valid
  capability via `orca.register_capability(...)`, or the load fails. Each capability must
  resolve `get_name()`, and `(type, name)` must be unique within the plugin.

---

## Execution model: how the app calls a plugin

Capabilities are reached **by type, not by name**. There is no per‑type instantiation
registry: a capability's Python class subclasses a typed C++ base, the package registers it
via `register_capability`, and each workflow call site narrows the stored capability instance
(`PluginCapabilityInterface`) with `std::dynamic_pointer_cast<ConcreteType>`. If the cast
succeeds, the capability is present and is invoked; if not (no such capability installed or
enabled), the path is a no‑op — which is how the system guarantees that absent/disabled
capabilities never change existing behavior.

| Capability type | Entry method | Invoked by |
|---|---|---|
| `post-processing` (G‑code) | `execute(ctx)` | `PostProcessor` during G‑code export, resolving the preset's plugin refs |
| `script` | `execute()` | the **Plugins dialog → Run** action |
| `printer-connection` | agent methods | `NetworkAgentFactory`, registered through a loader on‑capability‑load callback wired in `GUI_App` |

The on‑load / on‑unload **callbacks** (`PluginLoader::subscribe_on_load_callback` /
`subscribe_on_unload_callback`) and the per‑capability variants
(`subscribe_on_capability_load_callback` / `subscribe_on_capability_unload_callback`) are how
subsystems react to plugins and capabilities appearing or disappearing — e.g. the
printer‑agent layer registers/deregisters an agent for each `PrinterConnection` capability,
and the Plugins dialog refreshes. Adding a new type and wiring a call site is covered in
[`plugin_development.md`](plugin_development.md).

---

## Threading and the GIL

- **The interpreter is initialized on the main thread.** CPython is started once via
  `PythonInterpreter` (singleton). Initializing it off the main thread risks heap
  corruption, so `PluginManager::initialize()` does it eagerly and synchronously.
- **After init the GIL is released** (`PyEval_SaveThread`) and reacquired at shutdown, so
  other threads may take it.
- **Plugin loads run on worker threads**, serialized by a static mutex so module imports
  don't race. Discovery can also run on a background thread (`discover_plugins(async=true)`),
  though startup discovery is synchronous.
- **Every touch of Python from a non‑main thread acquires the GIL** through the
  `PythonGILState` RAII guard (`PyGILState_Ensure` / `Release`) — load, execute, and the
  instance destructor (`on_unload` + `Py_DECREF`) all wrap in it.

---

## Cloud subscriptions

`CloudPluginService` wraps the cloud agent (`OrcaCloudServiceAgent`) and is gated on login.
It fetches the manifests of subscribed/owned plugins, merges them into the catalog as an
overlay, and downloads a plugin's payload (sniffing the file to tell a `.whl` from a `.py`)
to a temporary file. `PluginManager` sets the loader's cloud user id, and `PluginLoader`
installs the downloaded payload under `orca_plugins/_subscribed/<user_id>/`. Logging out
unloads cloud plugins. The cloud auth token (`orca_refresh_token.sec`) is owned by the cloud
agent, not by the plugin layer.

---

## Plugin references in presets

When a setting points at a plugin capability (for example `post_process_plugin`), the value
the setting stores is just the capability's **name**. So that the reference survives being
copied to another machine — where the plugin might not be installed — each preset also carries
a `plugins` array that records the **full reference** for every capability it uses.

Each entry is a single string with three `;`‑separated fields:

```
<plugin_name>;<cloud_uuid>;<capability_name>
```

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "Sample Plugin;1f998ea9-0183-4cc5-957f-4eef659ba4e6;G-code Benchmark (.py)",
    "master_plugin;;header-stamp"
  ],
  "post_process_plugin": ["G-code Benchmark (.py)", "header-stamp"]
}
```

- The **`cloud_uuid`** is present for plugins subscribed from OrcaCloud and **empty** for
  local‑only plugins (note the adjacent `;;`). It is what lets OrcaSlicer offer to restore a
  missing plugin automatically.
- Because `;` is the field separator, a **capability name may not contain `;`** (the loader
  rejects such a plugin), and plugin display names have any `;` replaced with `_`
  (`sanitize_plugin_name`).
- The `plugins` array is an internal manifest (`coStrings`, `comDevelop` mode — not a
  user‑edited field). Fields that hold a capability name are flagged `support_plugin`; on
  save the array is **pruned** to only the references still used by such a field, so stale
  entries drop out.
- Parsing/serialization lives in `Config.cpp` (`parse_capability_ref` →
  `PluginCapabilityRef{ name, capability_name, uuid }`); the `plugins` option is defined in
  `PrintConfig.cpp` and is tracked on **process, printer, and filament** presets. See
  `tests/libslic3r/test_config.cpp` and
  `tests/slic3rutils/test_plugin_capability_identifier.cpp`.

## Restoring missing plugins

When you prepare to slice, OrcaSlicer resolves the active process, printer, and filament
presets' `plugins` arrays against the loaded catalog (`Plater::refresh_missing_plugin_block`).
Any reference it cannot satisfy is surfaced as a **non-closable notification**, and while any
remain the **Slice button stays blocked** — there is no "slice anyway" path; you resolve the
reference (or change the setting that pulls it in). References are sorted into four buckets:

- **Missing OrcaCloud plugins** (ref carries a UUID) — notification action **Install Plugins**,
  which subscribes to, installs, loads, and enables each one so it becomes usable immediately.
- **Missing local plugins** (no UUID) — cannot be fetched automatically; the action **Find on
  OrcaCloud** just opens a browser search on the OrcaCloud plugins page. It is a suggestion
  only: it neither closes the notification nor unblocks slicing.
- **Inactive plugins** — the package is installed locally but the referenced capability is not
  active (plugin not loaded, or capability disabled). Action **Activate Now** loads/enables it
  locally, with no download.
- **Broken references** — the plugin is installed and loaded but no longer provides the
  referenced capability (renamed/removed/outdated). Activation cannot fix this, so it is
  informational, with **Find on OrcaCloud** to look for an update.

The bucketing lives in `PluginResolver` (`get_missing_cloud_plugins`, `get_missing_local_plugins`,
`get_inactive_plugins`, `get_broken_plugins`); the notifications and the slice block are driven
from `Plater.cpp` (`refresh_missing_plugin_block`).

## The Plugins dialog

The Plugins dialog (`PluginsDialog.cpp` + `resources/web/dialog/PluginsDialog/`) presents each
installed plugin as an expandable row (Activate · Name · Version · Status). Expanding a plugin
shows a **capability tree** — one row per registered capability with its own enable checkbox,
type label, and (for runnable script capabilities) a **Run** button. The details pane is
tabbed:

| Tab | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Plugin Info** | thumbnail, source, types, author, version (with an update badge) |
| **Description** | the plugin's own description, taken from its Python/wheel metadata |
| **Changelog** | version / date / changes table |
| **Diagnostics** | load status and any error state |

Installing is done from a **Browse plugins** split dropdown that opens the OrcaCloud plugins
hub, with an **Install local plugin** option for side‑loading a `.py` or `.whl` directly.
Per‑plugin and per‑capability enablement is persisted in a per‑plugin `.install_state.json`
sidecar (written by `PluginManager`).

---

## Security and observability

- **Security** — all C++→Python calls cross a trampoline that opens a per‑call audit context;
  the `PluginAuditManager` audit hook then filters sensitive operations (today: a filesystem
  write allow‑list rooted at `data_dir()`, plus scoped roots such as the current G‑code
  folder). This is groundwork, not a hardened sandbox — read
  [`plugin_audit_hook.md`](plugin_audit_hook.md) for exactly what is and isn't enforced.
- **Observability** — Python `sys.stderr` (plugin tracebacks, including from
  plugin‑spawned threads) is teed to `data_dir()/log/python_*.log`; C++‑side
  load/discovery messages go to the main session log. How errors surface in the UI (message
  box vs. the plugin details area) is described in
  [`plugin_development.md`](plugin_development.md#how-errors-are-surfaced).

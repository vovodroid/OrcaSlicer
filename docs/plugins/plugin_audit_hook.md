# Plugin Audit Hook

OrcaSlicer's plugin system runs Python, which is extremely capable — it can read and
write files, spawn processes, open sockets, and load native code. To keep plugins from
reaching outside what they legitimately need, we install a **CPython audit hook** that
inspects sensitive runtime operations performed by plugin code and blocks the ones that
fall outside an allow‑list.

> **Scope of this version.** This is intentionally a *narrow, low‑risk first version* —
> groundwork, not a complete sandbox. Today it enforces one thing: **file writes are
> restricted to an allow‑list of directories** while a plugin is executing. Reads are
> left permissive so Python can still import modules. Process/network/native‑code events
> are *not* yet enforced. See [Limitations](#limitations) before relying on it as a
> security boundary.

## What is a plugin audit hook?

CPython exposes an auditing API (PEP 578). Any interpreter‑wide hook registered with
`PySys_AddAuditHook` is called *before* the runtime performs a sensitive operation — for
example opening a file (`open`), spawning a subprocess (`subprocess.Popen`), or connecting
a socket (`socket.connect`). The hook receives the event name and its arguments and may
abort the operation by setting a Python exception and returning a non‑zero value.

We register exactly **one** such hook, once, from `PythonInterpreter::initialize()` via
`PluginAuditManager::instance().install_hook()`. Everything else — *which* plugin is
running, *what* mode it runs under, and *which* directories it may touch — is tracked by
`PluginAuditManager`.

The hook itself is global to the interpreter, but it only enforces anything when a plugin
**audit context** is active (see below). Non‑plugin Python code, and plugin loading before
the context is set, pass through untouched.

---

## How it works

There are three moving parts. Keep them distinct — conflating them is the usual source of
confusion.

### 1. Audit identity — *who* is running (set once, per instance)

Every plugin instance carries a C++‑only identity string, never exposed to Python:

```cpp
// PythonPluginInterface.hpp
class PluginCapabilityInterface {
public:
    void               set_audit_plugin_key(std::string key);
    const std::string& audit_plugin_key() const;
private:
    std::string m_audit_plugin_key;   // == PluginDescriptor::plugin_key
};
```

This is the canonical runtime ID, `PluginDescriptor::plugin_key`. It is stamped onto the
instance by the loader **after** the plugin is captured and **before** `on_load()` runs:

- `PluginLoader::load_plugin_impl()` → `set_audit_plugin_key(descriptor.plugin_key)`
- `PluginLoader::update_loaded_plugin_key()` → re‑stamps it if a key is migrated

Stamping the identity does **not** turn on enforcement — it only labels the object so that
later calls know which plugin they belong to. This matters because printer‑agent plugins
are later invoked through `IPrinterAgent` / `NetworkAgent`, where the original `plugin_key`
is no longer available at the call site; the instance carries it instead.

### 2. Audit context — *how strict*, for the duration of one call (set per call)

The active plugin, mode, and scoped roots live in thread‑local state on
`PluginAuditManager`. They are set and restored by an RAII guard,
`ScopedPluginAuditContext`:

```cpp
// constructor: remember previous state, then apply the new plugin/mode and clear scoped roots
ScopedPluginAuditContext(const std::string& plugin_key,
                         AuditMode mode = AuditMode::Loading);
// destructor: restore the previous plugin/mode/scoped-roots
```

A context is constructed at the **start of every C++ → Python trampoline call** and
destroyed when that call returns or throws. So enforcement is *per call*: outside any
trampoline call the mode is just its default and `current_plugin()` is empty, so the hook
allows everything.

### 3. Audit modes — what "strict" means

```cpp
enum class AuditMode {
    // Permissive reads, restricted writes. Python must be able to read stdlib
    // modules and the plugin file during import/on-load, so reads are allowed;
    // only writes outside the allowed roots are blocked.
    Loading,

    // Restricted reads AND writes: every file path must resolve inside an
    // allowed root, or it is blocked.
    Enforcing,
};
```

The check that implements this is `PluginAuditManager::check_open(path, mode)`:

1. Empty path → allow.
2. No active plugin (`current_plugin()` empty) → allow.
3. `Loading` **and** the open is a read (`mode` has no `w`/`a`/`+`) → allow (early‑out).
4. Otherwise the path must resolve inside a **scoped allowed root** or the **global
   allowed root**, else it is blocked.

So the only difference between the two modes is step 3: `Loading` lets reads through before
the allow‑list check; `Enforcing` does not, so reads are subject to the same allow‑list as
writes.

### Allowed roots

There are two tiers, checked in this order:

| Tier | Stored in | Lifetime | Set by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scoped** | thread‑local, cleared on every new context | one call | `add_scoped_allowed_root()` inside an `audit_setup` callback |
| **Global** | shared, mutex‑guarded | process | `add_global_allowed_root()` in `install_hook()` |

In this version the global allow‑list contains **only `data_dir()`**. The executable
directory and resources directory are deliberately *not* allowed — plugins must not write
there. G‑code plugins additionally get the temp G‑code folder as a *scoped* root for the
duration of their `execute()` call.

Path matching (`is_inside_allowed_root`) canonicalizes both paths with
`weakly_canonical` (resolving symlinks without requiring existence) and does a
component‑wise prefix match that rejects any `..` traversal.

### Putting it together — the flow of one call

```

---

## Audit hook development

The point of interest is **`PluginAuditManager.hpp` / `.cpp`** (the modes, the events, and
the policy) and the trampoline macros in **`PyPluginTrampoline.hpp`** (how each plugin
function opts into a mode).

### Handling events

Events are dispatched by name in `PluginAuditManager::audit_hook`. Return `0` to allow;
set a Python exception and return non‑zero (we use `-1`) to block:

```cpp
int PluginAuditManager::audit_hook(const char* event, PyObject* args, void* user_data)
{
    auto* mgr = static_cast<PluginAuditManager*>(user_data);
    std::string event_name(event ? event : "");

    if (event_name == "open") {
        // CPython passes ("open", path, mode, flags)
        const char* path = nullptr; const char* mode = nullptr; int flags = 0;
        if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "s|si", &path, &mode, &flags)) {
            PyErr_Clear();
            return 0;                       // couldn't parse — allow
        }
        if (!mgr->check_open(path ? path : "", mode ? mode : "r").allowed) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_PermissionError,
                            "Plugin attempted to access a blocked file path");
            return -1;                      // block
        }
        return 0;
    }

    // else if (event_name == "os.rename") { ... }   // see below

    return 0;                               // unhandled event — allow
}
```

To audit a new operation, add another `else if` branch. **Each event has its own argument
tuple** — you cannot assume `(path, mode, flags)`. Look the event up in the official table
and parse accordingly:

- `os.rename` → `(src, dst, src_dir_fd, dst_dir_fd)`
- `os.remove` → `(path, dir_fd)`
- `os.mkdir`  → `(path, mode, dir_fd)`
- `subprocess.Popen` → `(executable, args, cwd, env)`

The complete, version‑specific list of audit events and their arguments:
**https://docs.python.org/3/library/audit_events.html**

For filesystem mutations you'll usually want to route the extracted path(s) through
`check_open(path, "w")` (or a dedicated checker) so they share the same allow‑list logic.

### Defining the audit mode of a function

Every C++ → Python plugin call crosses a trampoline method, and those methods wrap the
pybind11 override in the `ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED` macro
(`PyPluginTrampoline.hpp`). The macro both (a) logs and rethrows Python exceptions at the
single boundary and (b) opens the audit context. Its signature:

```cpp
ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(mode, audit_setup, override_macro, ret, base, name, /* args... */)
```

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `AuditMode::Loading` or `AuditMode::Enforcing` for this call |
| `audit_setup` | a callable (often `[] {}`) run *after* the context is constructed — use it to register scoped roots |
| `override_macro` | `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE` or `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE_PURE` |
| `ret, base, name, …` | the usual pybind11 override arguments |

When you add a new method to any trampoline, **you must choose its mode** based on what the
function legitimately needs:

```cpp
void on_load() override
{
    ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(
        ::Slic3r::PluginAuditManager::AuditMode::Loading,   // imports during load → reads allowed
        [] {},                                              // no extra setup
        PYBIND11_OVERRIDE,
        void, Base, on_load);
}
```

Rule of thumb:

- Use **`Loading`** for lifecycle/setup calls that may import modules (`on_load`,
  `on_unload`, `get_type`) or any call where you only care about restricting writes.
- Use **`Enforcing`** for calls that should also be prevented from *reading* outside the
  allow‑list. Be aware this will block lazily‑imported stdlib/3rd‑party modules read from
  disk during the call, so only use it where the plugin is not expected to import at call
  time.

### Adding per‑call allowed roots (the `audit_setup` callback)

`ScopedPluginAuditContext`'s constructor **clears** the scoped roots, so any scoped root
must be added *after* construction — which is exactly what `audit_setup` is for. The G‑code
trampoline uses it to grant write access to the folder holding the current temp G‑code
file:

```cpp
ExecutionResult execute(const GCodePluginContext& ctx) override
{
    ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(
        ::Slic3r::PluginAuditManager::AuditMode::Loading,
        [&] {                                               // runs only when a context is active
            if (!ctx.gcode_path.empty())
                ::Slic3r::PluginAuditManager::instance().add_scoped_allowed_root(
                    std::filesystem::path(ctx.gcode_path).parent_path());
        },
        PYBIND11_OVERRIDE_PURE,
        ExecutionResult, GCodePlugin, execute, ctx);
}
```

The callback runs only when the instance has a non‑empty audit key (i.e. a context was
actually opened), so it's safe to assume enforcement is live inside it.

### Adding a global allowed root

If *every* plugin should be allowed a directory, add it in `install_hook()`:

```cpp
void PluginAuditManager::install_hook()
{
    PySys_AddAuditHook(audit_hook, this);
    add_global_allowed_root(data_dir());          // the only global root today
    // add_global_allowed_root(std::filesystem::temp_directory_path());  // e.g. to allow /tmp
}
```

Prefer scoped roots over global ones — a global root widens the boundary for *all* plugins
and is process‑lifetime. Only add a global root when the access is genuinely universal.

### Identity wiring (rarely touched)

If you add a new way to load or re‑key plugin instances, make sure the new path also calls
`set_audit_plugin_key()` — otherwise the instance has an empty key and **no context is ever
opened**, so its calls run completely unaudited. The existing call sites are
`PluginLoader::load_plugin_impl()` and `PluginLoader::update_loaded_plugin_key()`.

---

## Current policy at a glance

| Plugin call | Mode | Effective access |
|---|---|---|
| `on_load` / `on_unload` / `get_type` | `Loading` | read anywhere; write only under `data_dir()` |
| G‑code `execute()` | `Loading` | + write under the current temp G‑code folder |
| Script `execute()` | `Loading` | read anywhere; write only under `data_dir()` |
| Printer‑agent methods | `Loading` | read anywhere; write only under `data_dir()` |

> Modes are chosen at each trampoline call site, so this table reflects the current source —
> always check the actual `ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED(...)` call when in doubt.

---

## Limitations

This version is deliberately minimal. Do **not** treat it as a hardened sandbox. Known gaps:

- **Only the `open` event is enforced.** `subprocess.Popen`, `os.system`, `socket.*`,
  `ctypes.*` and friends are *not* blocked. (The `Enforcing` enum comment describes an
  aspiration, not current behavior.)
- **`os.open` slips through.** It raises the `open` event with `mode = None`, so the
  `"s|si"` parse fails and the call is allowed. Low‑level opens are currently unaudited.
- **`open(path, "x")`** (exclusive create — a write) contains no `w`/`a`/`+`, so it is
  classified as a read and allowed under `Loading`.
- **Non‑`open` filesystem mutations are unaudited.** `os.remove`, `os.rename`, `os.mkdir`,
  `shutil.*` raise their own events, which we don't yet handle — a plugin can delete or
  rename files outside `data_dir()` without tripping anything.
- Enforcement is **per process / per thread** via thread‑locals; code that hops threads
  without re‑establishing a context runs unaudited.

Closing these gaps (especially the filesystem‑mutation events and `os.open` flags) is the
natural next step for anyone hardening this into a real write‑sandbox.

---

## Debugging

Enforcement only fires while a context is active, and the read/write distinction trips
people up, so when something is unexpectedly blocked (or unexpectedly allowed), get the
facts first.

**Temporary block log.** `check_open` logs each block just before returning, including the
mode that was actually live:

```
[AUDIT] block path=/tmp open_mode=w audit_mode=Loading plugin=local:.../Environment_Report_Script_
```

Read it field by field:

- `open_mode=w` → it's a **write**. Under `Loading`, writes outside the allow‑list are
  *supposed* to be blocked. A blocked `open_mode=r` under `audit_mode=Loading` is
  impossible from current source — if you see it, your binary is stale (see below).
- `audit_mode=` → tells you whether the live call site is `Loading` or `Enforcing`, which
  is the quickest way to confirm a trampoline change actually took effect.
- `path=` → the resolved path that failed the allow‑list. Compare against `data_dir()`.

The permanent `report_violation` log (`[AUDIT BLOCKED] …`) fires on the same blocks and
includes the plugin key, event name, path, and reason.

**Common pitfalls**

- **Read vs write.** `Loading` never blocks a read. If a "read" is blocked, it's actually a
  write (check `open_mode`), or the mode is `Enforcing`.
- **Stale / incremental builds.** `PyPluginTrampoline.hpp` and `PluginAuditManager.hpp` are
  included by many translation units. A header‑only change (e.g. flipping a trampoline's
  mode) may not propagate with an incremental build. If runtime behavior contradicts the
  source, do a clean rebuild of the affected targets. `PluginAuditManager.cpp` changes are
  a single‑TU recompile + relink.
- **No context = no enforcement.** If a plugin's calls are never audited, check that its
  instance got `set_audit_plugin_key()` (non‑empty key) and that the method actually wraps
  through `ORCA_PY_OVERRIDE_AUDITED`.
